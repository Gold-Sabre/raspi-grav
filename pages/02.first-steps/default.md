title: 'First Steps'

##### Goals
* **Install Raspbian** as your Raspberry Pi's operating system
* Get your raspi's **basic configuration** and **updating** out of the way
* Make it run **headless** (accessible via SSH from a different computer), rather than keeping a monitor, keyboard, etc. attached
* Take steps to somewhat **harden** your raspi, since my guides will have it running services accessible to the internet 
* Add a **testing branch** for updates that may be a better fit for a raspi vs. stable releases
