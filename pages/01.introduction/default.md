>>> **This website is actively under construction!** If you're reading this, I'm not done with this website. I have no schedule to which I adhere, so it'll be done when it's done!

##### My Goal
Hi there! I want to provide step-by-step tutorials on how to set up and run various handy services using a Raspberry Pi. These guides will be limited to the realm of a homelab type environment, and only cover things that I've done myself and managed to get working. To write the content of this site, I'm translating my personal rough notes into beautified, followable, and understandable pages. 

##### Things to note
* This website is running on my **Raspberry Pi 2**, so that's promising
* I'm using **Raspbian Jessie**. At the time of writing, the next version of Raspbian dubbed "Stretch" has been released; that being said, I don't plan on updating for a long while, or until the services I run are likely up to par.
* Near the beginning I'll be more precise and long-winded, because my notes are also more detailed
* As things get moving, I'll become more concise as both your understanding grows and my notes get thinner
* As much as I'd like to give superbly thorough instructions all the way through, I'm not willing to re-build my raspi now that everything's configured and working harmoniously 
* Most of my notes have been compiled by taking fragments of a solution from multiple locations and after hours of searching; as such, I can't source a lot of my content. **My goal isn't to write a paper; I want to record my experience for your benefit, not make you slog through Google!**
